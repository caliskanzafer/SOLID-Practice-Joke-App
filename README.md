# SOLID Principles Practice Project

This project was created to practice implementing the SOLID principles in a simple iOS application. The project consists of 1 screen where users can view Chuck Norris jokes and add them to their favorites.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of the SOLID principles in software development. While the project's functionality is minimal, the focus is on adhering to SOLID principles rather than building a fully functional application.

## Documentation

I have written a Medium article discussing the implementation of SOLID principles in this project. You can find the article [here](https://medium.com/appcent/swift-dilinde-solid-prensipleri-ve-projede-kullanımı-b6bcad7b70f3).

Additionally, you can refer to the accompanying PDF document for detailed notes on the SOLID principles applied in this project: [PDF](SOLID-Practice/solid-notes.pdf).

## Code Review

If you are interested in reviewing the code and observing violations of SOLID principles along with their corrections, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `main` branch to see the initial implementation.
2. Check out the `refactor` branch to view the improved and refactored code.

## Feedback

Your feedback is valuable to me! If you have any suggestions, questions, or comments, please feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zfrclskn_). Your input helps me improve as a developer and writer.

Thank you for your interest and happy coding!
